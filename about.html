                It was thanks to a client that Leif and Karl met, indeed during a traditional Indian wedding the family of the bride asked for the services of our two photographers. It was on the Indian plateau that the two Finnish photographers met. Complementary, the joint work within their agency allowed a great diversity in their works and their creations. Allowing you to offer a wide choice to you, the customers.
                Their two-year collaboration has now enabled more than 240 clients to obtain unique, high-quality photos.
